# GovTech for New Zealand

This organisation and the repositories within it are to support the New Zealand GovTech communities. The NZ GovTech Communities are groups of government employees and Microsoft technical experts who are working together to deliver quality outcomes for New Zealanders.  This collaboration focuses primarily on the use of Microsoft products and services to deliver these outcomes, but is not limited to Microsoft technologies.

We are a diverse group of people from across public sector who are using these repo's to share ideas, code and documents to help each other deliver quality outcomes for citizen New Zealanders.

## Repository Structure

The repositories within this organisation are structured to support the various govtech communities and their activities.  Repo's can be created to support any required activity, but the following are the primary categories of repo's that are currently in use:

> Azure - Azure Infrastructure, Data and AI and all services delivered on the Azure Platform

> Fabric - The Microsoft SaaS Data Platform

> Security - All security products like Sentinel, Defender, ATP, MCAS, AIP, etc

>M365 - Productivity tool focus such as Teams, SharePoint, Power Platform, etc
